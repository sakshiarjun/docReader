hi 
Meta is apparently deprioritizing VR and its Oculus business to focus on reproducing the surprising success of its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. And it makes sense — VR is out, AI is in, and Meta’s smart glasses 
are the absolute standout gadget thus far for AI. But in the same week that Alex Heath reported this shake-up in Command Line, The Information reported that Apple is focusing on a cheaper Vision headset in favor
of a successor to the Vision Pro. Something’s happening here, and it feels like it’s going to have a major impact on the most distinct visions of our VR and AR future.

So with David stepping away for a show, Alex Heath joins Nilay and myself to talk about what the heck is going on with AR and VR in Silicon Valley right now. But that’s not all we talk about. There’s also a very 
cool new universal remote with a big screen and a limited audience, Framework has a new laptop with a very curious processor, and Qualcomm’s new laptop processors are finally available to reviewers and the general 
public. While our team furiously benchmarks them, we dig into what it could mean for the wider industry.

And after those big discussions we, like Big Tech, pivot to talking about AI — because there was big news in that space this week, too! Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI’s former chief scientist and one of the major participants 
in last November’s attempted coup, has a whole new AI company. He doesn’t appear to have a big business plan, but he has grand ideas for the future of AI. Plus, Perplexity appears to be burning bridges to create a 
competitive AI search engine, and the tension between creators and the AI companies who want them both as customers and for training data grows more taut.

Finally, we hit a lightning round that’s got a surprising fashion focus.
